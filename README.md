# FreshG10: A Comprehensive Dataset for Multi-Class Freshness Grading of Fruits and Vegetables  

## Overview  
The **FreshG10 dataset** is designed to support automated freshness grading of fruits and vegetables using deep learning and computer vision.  
Freshness is a key factor in food safety, pricing efficiency, and quality assessment in agriculture. While existing grading systems often focus on size, shape, or damage, **FreshG10 introduces freshness-based grading** to address a critical gap in research and practice.  

This dataset provides a valuable benchmark for building accurate, cost-effective AI models for agricultural applications, with the goal of improving supply chain efficiency, reducing waste, and supporting scalable post-harvest quality control.  

## Features  
- **~2,500 high-quality images** of four commonly consumed vegetables and fruits:  
  - Cucumber  
  - Tomato  
  - Bitter Gourd  
  - Banana  
- Captured **daily over degradation cycles** to document freshness levels.  
- Organized into **10 distinct freshness classes**, from "fresh" to "fully spoiled".  
- Images annotated by multiple volunteers through visual inspection and consensus grading.  
- Supports **multi-class classification** tasks, surpassing traditional binary fresh/rotten systems.  

## Applications  
- Automated fruit and vegetable grading  
- Freshness detection and prediction  
- Computer vision and deep learning benchmarking  
- Food quality monitoring and agricultural supply chain optimization  

## Benchmarking  
State-of-the-art models including **ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and NASNet** have been evaluated on this dataset.  
Results confirm FreshG10â€™s value as a challenging and robust benchmark for **multi-class image classification** in agriculture.
